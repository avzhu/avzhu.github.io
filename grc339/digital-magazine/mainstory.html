                    <h2>Modern Styles</h2>
                    
                        <p>In recent years, the world has witnessed a resurgence in Hanfu fashion. Gen Y and Gen Z shoppers have started a movement out of a desire to embrace their cultures and express the beauty of their national identity to the world. The ever growing influence of social media, including but not limited to Instagram, TikTok, and Chinese social media platforms like The Little Red Book (小紅書) and Douyin (抖音), has catapulted the Hanfu movement to the forefront of the modern Chinese culture scene.</p>

                        <p>The Hanfu, meaning the clothes of the Han people, had faded into the background when the Manchus ruled during the Qing Dynasty. These clothes represented the Han ethnic minority who, at the time, were the Manchu’s political rivals. Now, however, it has become the center of popular culture for Chinese people of all genders and ages. </p>

                        <p>Hanfus, in ancient Chinese culture, was reserved mostly for special occasions with its intricate and striking designs. In modern day fashion, we have seen more and more people style different elements of traditional Hanfu with modern day clothing. Many people style the ma mian qun, a type of pleated skirt, with a simple T-shirt or a neat blouse as a way to show off elements of traditional Chinese clothing without the over-the-top intricacy of a full, traditional Hanfu. Some have evolved the long and elegant skirts that women wore, into flowy pants that are easier to manage and move in. Some have even gone away with the traditional styled lower garment and opted to wear fancy upper garments or modernized Hanfu jackets with regular, business-casual slacks.</p>

                        <p>The outer jacket of the Hanfu has, in some cases, been modified into a shorter and lighter style that can be paired with clothing in modern day fashion. Sometimes the traditional inner camisole is replaced with a simple collared dress shirt or blouse. Other times, the long, flowy skirts in the woman’s Hanfu are substituted by cute, shorter skirts that give a youthful look to the younger generation that chooses to style their Hanfus in such a way.</p>

                        <p>Hanfus have slowly been integrated into modern day fashion in bits and pieces. Although modern Hanfus are more commonly mass produced, with machine sewn patterns, there are still many online and in person stores that hand makes custom designed Hanfus. The intricate details and patterns are not lost in either form of production and showcase the beauty of traditional Chinese wear. </p>

                                    Hanfu clothing worn by women includes a flowing robe called Ruqun (襦裙) with a loose top and a long skirt. The modern adaptations of this traditional style include these elements into everyday clothing with shorter cuts, tighter fits, and thinner fabrics.

                                    The Hanfu — meaning the clothing of the Han people — is a general term used to describe the traditional Chinese clothing that originated in the ancient Chinese dynasties. The first Hanfu was developed over 3000 years ago and was often worn to indicate one’s wealth and social status depending on the style and pattern designs (Hanfu – History and Facts About Hanfu). The Hanfus were designed with intricate patterns and styles that corresponded to the dynasties that they were designed in. Let’s take a look at some of the distinct differences between the Hanfus of each dynasty.
