                                    With the help of social media, Chinese culture has taken the world by a storm. The traditional Chinese garment, the Hanfu, has made a resurgence in the media, but with a modern twist. More and more people are embracing the intricate beauty of this traditional chinese wear, whether it be with all the details and pieces of the Hanfus during the Chinese dynasties era or paired with modern clothing.

                                    In ancient China, the Han people would wear accessories with their Hanfus, whether it be for ornamental purposes or cooling purposes. From hair pins to pendants to fans, each accessory is decorated with detailed artworks. Some of these accessories serve the dual purpose of flaunting the beautiful accessories one owns and to protect themselves from the harsh natural elements (hats, fans, umbrellas, etc.).

                                    Hanfu clothing worn by women includes a flowing robe called Ruqun (襦裙) with a loose top and a long skirt. The modern adaptations of this traditional style include these elements into everyday clothing with shorter cuts, tighter fits, and thinner fabrics.

                                    Hanfu clothing for men usually features a cross robe called Zhiduo (直裰) or Beizi (褙子) which are worn over inner layers and a pair of wide legged pants. Modern styles include features of traditional clothing into more day to day clothing with lighter fabric and tighter fits.

                                    For modern hairstyles, it is common to wear readymade wigs and extensions for styling and volume. This is woven in with one’s natural hair for an accessorized but natural look. Natural hair can also be braided and pinned with accessories or normal hairstyles can be worn for a more modernist style. The traditional hanfu hairstyles have elaborate detailing due to the cultural significance of Confucianism in its filial piety of showing respect to one’s parents. Cutting hair was considered harmful to one’s body which was given from one’s parents. Therefore hair was kept long but maintained by intricate knotting and wrapping of one’s hair.

                                <p>
                                    The Hanfu — meaning the clothing of the Han people — is a general term used to describe the traditional Chinese clothing that originated in the ancient Chinese dynasties. The first Hanfu was developed over 3000 years ago and was often worn to indicate one’s wealth and social status depending on the style and pattern designs (Hanfu – History and Facts About Hanfu). The Hanfus were designed with intricate patterns and styles that corresponded to the dynasties that they were designed in. Let’s take a look at some of the distinct differences between the Hanfus of each dynasty.

                                    The makeup worn with Hanfus uses red eyeshadow on eyes, cheeks, and lips whereas rouge was used traditionally. This red color represents good luck and happiness for the wearer. The huadian (花鈿), meaning little flower, is worn using red on the forehead as ornamental makeup representing a flower. This was popular during the Tang and Song dynasties and is now mostly worn with Hanfus.

                                    There are many different types of footwear that were worn with the Hanfu. These shoes were made with a variation of materials. The type of shoes that were worn also varied depending on the specific occasion. The types of shoes that were worn on a daily basis was typically a sign of social class as well.
